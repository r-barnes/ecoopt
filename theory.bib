	abstract = {A model is constructed of organisms which optimize their reproduction in a randomly varying environment, and can also receive some information about their environment. The model is of organisms which complete their reproduction and life cycle within a discrete time interval and produce seeds in yields which are random variables depending on environmental conditions. Maximal long-term growth rate of the organism is achieved when for each environmental event or signal, which may be correlated with eventual yield, there is an optimal fraction of seeds which germinate. These optimal responses depend on the probabilities of yields, on the conditional probabilities between the external signals and the yields, which are a measure of the degree of correlation between the external signals and the yields, and on the viability of seeds which do not germinate. It has been shown in this model that optimized long-term growth rate is increased by increased correlation between external signals and yields, which is equivalent to the amount of relevant information about the environment which is processed by the organism.

The quantity of external information to be processed may be minimized without decreasing growth by lumping together those external signals for which the optimized responses are identical.},

	abstract = {To analyse the whole life of higher plants, an attempt was made to describe their growth and reproduction by mathematical models based on the elements determining matter production and economy of the matter. A plant body was regarded as a compound system of two parts; “productive part” and “reproductive part”. A parameter (reproductive index) was introduced to connect these two parts, and a set of the mathematical models describing the quantitative growth of these two parts were established.
Two basic patterns of reproduction in higher plants were distinguished into “D-reproduction” and “I-reproduction”. The state of matter production of the mother plant determined an initial size of the daughter plant in theD-reproduction, while, in theI-reproduction, it did not determine the initial size of the daughter, but determined the number of propagules. The model of each reproduction pattern was also constructed. A formula determining the initial size of a plant in a given generation was constructed as the model of the reproduction. The model for the reproduction described the number of propagules produced in a given generation. Some aspects of the plant life, e.g. the optimum reproductive index, the switch-over time from the vegetative to the reproductive growth phase, the seed number, types of expansive reproduction, were theoretically analysed and discussed under these mathematical models.},

	abstract = {At any given moment in time a plant is partitioning total growth mass into its various component parts such as leaves, roots, reproductive material, etc. The view is taken that the plant has evolved a life history strategy to control this partitioning process. This paper illustrates the utility of optimal control theory for use in determining life history strategies which maximize fitness for a given asexual plant model. The optimal control methods are first used on a model previously analyzed by Professor Dan Cohen, who used a different method. His results of a change from 100\% vegetable growth to 100\% reproductive growth at a fixed switching time is again obtained. This 100\% switching result is shown to be more generally applicable by using a qualitatively described model. However the switching time in general is shown to be a function of both leaf mass and time remaining to the end of the growing season. The allocation to toxin production is also considered. It is shown that under this model an inequality between system parameters must be satisfied before the plant should allocate growth to toxin production. Although the particular model explored here may rarely be realistic in nature, these same methods of optimal control theory can be applied in a similar fashion to many other proposed models of plant resource allocation.},

Using the Weierstrass theorem, we show that a solution of the optimization problem exists. The problem is further solved analytically using the Pontryagin maximum principle. The main conclusion of the paper is that in a given environment an optimal body size exists, one which maximizes the energy channeled to the production of progeny. This body size depends on the mortality rate, the maximum life span, and the derivative of the growth equation with respect to body size.

	abstract = {The optimal growth schedule of a plant with two vegetative parts is studied to investigate the balance between shoot and root. An intuitive justification of optimization procedures used in Pontryagin's maximum principle is obtained by defining the marginal values of shoot size, root size, and reproductive activity at various times of the season and deriving their differential equations and terminal conditions. The optimal growth pattern which maximizes the total reproductive activity during the season is composed of the convergence of a plant's shape to a balanced growth path, followed by simultaneous growth of shoot and root (balanced growth), ending with the reproductive growth. Along the balanced growth path, a plant has a root/shoot ratio which maximizes the daily net photosynthesis for a given total biomass. The model also shows a simultaneous stop of shoot and root growth when the reproduction begins, the dependence of root/shoot ratio on age, water and light availability, etc., the convergence of a plant's shape to the balanced growth after pruning or an environmental change.},

The effects of parameter changes on the value of the ESS germination fraction are determined in some limiting cases by analyses of approximations. Numerical solutions of the ESS criterion are used to check the robustness of the conclusions and the accuracy of the approximations. In general, the ESS germination fraction decreases with an increased survivorship of buried seeds and with increased “variability” of seed yields. However, different measures of “variability” are appropriate in different circumstances. To avoid the possibility of conflicting predictions depending on the measure of variability, it is suggested that tests of the theory be limited to co-occurring species, and to variability due to climatic fluctuations. The ESS theory based on the Reciprocal Yield Law is compared with D. Cohen's (1966, J. Theor. Biol.12, 119–129; 1968, J. Ecol.56, 219–228) density-independent theory of “optimal” germination. The theories differ qualitatively and quantitatively regarding the influence of mean yield, seed survivorship, and the frequency of favorable years on the predicted germination fraction.},

In this study, a system model of energy flows in arable lowland grassland in central Japan is considered. The model is composed of the following seven compartments: above-ground plant biomass, below-ground live biomass, standing dead material, surface litter, herbage ingested by grazing cattle, cattle biomass and feces; and the following two energy flows are dealt with: (1) sun → plants → standing dead material → litter → soil organic matter; and (2) plants → cattle. Energy flows between the seven compartments are described by eight simultaneous differential equations, and parameters in the model were determined from field experiments.

The results are as follows: an optimal stocking rate with increases in total cattle body weight obtained during the year can attain a maximum when cattle with a total body weight of 1625 kg/ha, at the beginning of the grazing season, were grazed. Energy flows under such conditions are as follows, in kJ m−2 year−1: global solar radiation (ca. 473 × 104) → photosynthetically active radiation (ca. 191 × 104) → energy fixed in above-ground plant portion (17 460) → energy grazed by cattle (17 468) → net seconndary production (761).},

When temporary storage of energy is impossible or too costly, a gradual switch from vegetative to reproductive growth will be optimal.

	abstract = {A continuous-time model, similar to W. M. Schaffer's (1983, Amer. Nat.121, 418–431), of growth and reproduction for a perennial herb with discrete growing seasons is considered. Assuming that metabolic rates of reproductive and storage structures are equal, it was possible, through the reduction of the continuous model to a discrete one, to find the optimal allocations to the vegetative, reproductive, and reserve structures. The main feature of the optimal strategy is the existence of an optimal reserve size. The allocation to vegetative structures is, every growing season, the allocation which maximizes the total of reproductive and reserve structures at the end of the season. The relative allocation between reserve and reproductive structures is given, when reproductive success is a linear function of investment, by the fastest growth to the optimal size: no reproduction until the optimal size is reached, and, afterwards, allocation to reproduction of everything beyond what is needed to maintain size R∗. Asymptotic growth to the equilibrium and cycles are possible, when reproductive success is a nonlinear function of investment (A. Pugliese, 1988, in “Biomathematics and Related Computational Problems” (L. M. Ricciardi, Ed.), Reidel, Dordrecht, to appear). It has therefore been possible to solve the “general life history problem” (Schaffer, 1983) when growth is in general a concave function of body size. In the Discussion discrete and continuous-time models are compared; if the real dynamics is described by a continuous model of the type analyzed here, life history predictions made by analyzing the system with a discrete model are upheld.},

	title = {Optimal growth schedule of a perennial plant},
	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2462084},
	abstract = {The optimal growth schedule of a deciduous perennial plant is studied theoretically. We make three basic assumptions. First, the daily net photosynthetic rate of a plant increases but saturates with the size of the production part (vegetative organs working for photosynthesis). Second, the production part is discarded at the end of a growing season, but it may be rebuilt at the beginning of the next season using stored material. And finally, the plant maximizes the lifetime reproductive investment by choosing both the growth schedule within each season and the resource allocation between reproduction for the year and storage for the next season. The model is analyzed by the combination of maximum principle and dynamic programming. Our analysis showed three basic results. First, the annual life cycle is optimal under low storage efficiency, low habitat reliability, low growth rate, and a short growing season. Second, under any other conditions, perennial growth is optimal. During years in which the final amount of resources is smaller than a critical value S*, the plant remains immature and saves all of the resources for the next season. If it becomes larger than S*, the plant invests the excess in reproductive activities and repeats the same growth schedule thereafter (steady state). Finally, reproductive effort (the ratio of reproductive investment to total annual production) of a mature plant is high for an annual, is lowest for a perennial just above the threshold for the perennial growth pattern, increases as the length of the season increases, and in a very productive habitat may even exceed the level for an annual. The ratio of the plant size established by stored material to the maximum plant size decreases with the length of the growing season, which quantitatively fits the available data. In light of the model, reported growth patterns and leaf phenology of many deciduous plants indicate that the nonlinearity of photosynthetic rate as a function of the size of the production part is important. For a case with nonlinear photosynthesis but without an upper limit to the leaf expansion rate, a plant's optimal phenology, if normalized by size, can be parameterized by two quantities: productivity (maximum relative growth rate multiplied by a season's length) and stability (annual survival multiplied by storage efficiency). The timing of the cessation of leaf production within a season by a small immature plant is determined by productivity (occurring later in a more productive habitat). Leaf production ends earlier in the season as the plant grows. The optimal time for ending leaf production in a mature plant, in contrast, is controlled mainly by stability (it ceases earlier at a more stable site) and is almost independent of productivity.},

The model is shown to generate testable hypotheses with respect to several characteristic features of annual plants growing in various environmental situations. Among the features examined are the timing of reproduction, the size of the mature vegetative body, and the annual yield of seeds. A “bang-bang” growth strategy is optimal in stochastic environments if natural selection acts to maximize the expected annual yield of seeds. Given this strategy plants follow the “most rapid approach path” to an optimal vegetative body, and they initiate reproductive growth once this mature body is reached. The size of the mature body depends on the environment, and the study expounds this dependency. If natural selection acts to maximize the expected annual rate of growth, which is equivalent to maximizing the expected value of the logarithm of the annual yield of seeds, a “bang-bang” growth plan is not likely to result in random environments. The optimal plan is graded. It is comprised of rather long and continuous period of allocating biomass to reproductive and vegetative growth simultaneously. This plan degenerates into a “bang-bang” plan in deterministic environments. Though the logarithmic plan is inferior in terms of expected annual yield, it is superior in terms of lower variance and susceptibility to probable extinction.},

It was found that for every mortality level there exists a critical proportion of persistent organs. Below this critical value it is optimal to grow without reproduction for the first years until a characteristic size is reached; afterwards, that size is maintained year after year and all extra resources are devoted to reproduction. Some storage is also necessary to maintain constant size. If the proportion of retained vegetative mass is above the critical value, the optimal strategy is gradual growth to an asymptotic size, with growth and reproduction occurring in several years following maturation. In this case real storage occurs only until maturation is reached, then storage is realized only by energy relocation from the vegetative body. Although the optimal solution changes abruptly qualitatively at a given proportion of resources saved from year to year, further growth of this proportion above the critical level brings about a greater difference between size reached at maturity and final size.

The model predicts that the scheme of stochasticity to which the plant has been adapted greatly affects its growth reaction to a given resource level. If the plant is adapted to a slowly changing environment, it should continue to grow until late in a favorable environment but should start reproduction earlier in an unfavorable one, showing large phenotypic plasticity. In contrast, plants adapted to a quickly changing environment should use an almost fixed growth schedule, irrespective of the current level of the environmental resource supply. Consequently, a plant adapted to the environment with usualy low nutrient level with occasional short flushes of nutrient supply would not produce a large vegetative organ when placed in a nutrient rich environment.

	abstract = {In dynamic models of energy allocation, assimilated energy is allocated to reproduction, somatic growth, maintenance or storage, and the allocation pattern can change with age. The expected evolutionary outcome is an optimal allocation pattern, but this depends on the environment experienced during the evolutionary process and on the fitness costs and benefits incurred by allocating resources in different ways. Here we review existing treatments which encompass some of the possibilities as regards constant or variable environments and their predictability or unpredictability, and the ways in which production rates and mortality rates depend on body size and composition and age and on the pattern of energy allocation. The optimal policy is to allocate resources where selection pressures are highest, and simultaneous allocation to several body subsystems and reproduction can be optimal if these pressures are equal. This may explain balanced growth commonly observed during ontogeny. Growth ceases at maturity in many models; factors favouring growth after maturity include non-linear trade-offs, variable season length, and production and mortality rates both increasing (or decreasing) functions of body size. We cannot yet say whether these are sufficient to account for the many known cases of growth after maturity and not all reasonable models have yet been explored. Factors favouring storage are also reviewed.},

	abstract = {The long-term growth and coexistence of species with large mixed populations in varying environments were modelled for representative environments and life-history characteristics of annual and perennial plants. The effects of the relationships between the means, variances, and covariances of seed yield, establishment, and survival, were explored by Taylor's expansion. The main findings are:

1. Individual variation in reproductive success within generations has no effect on long-term growth, which is determined only by the mean growth rate of the individuals of the species. 2. In annual species with nonoverlapping generations and without seed banks, the species with the largest mean log of the annual growth rate Y, that is the product of the average seed yield per plant and the establishment probability per seed, will win in competition with other species, independent of the correlations between the growth rates of the different species. In this case there is a negative tradeoff between the mean and the variance. 3. In perennial species with a lottery type of equal access to vacant sites, a high annual survival probability allows stable coexistence between perennial species with independent or negatively correlated variance in their mean annual product of seed production and establishment Y. 4. The coexistence range and the likely number of coexisting perennial species increase as a function of the variance of the common species, and is decreased by the variance of the rare species. The coexistence range is decreased by the covariance between the growth rates of the species, and between the survival of the rare species and its growth rate. 5. If mortality in the community of long-lived perennials is synchronized, the generations become nonoverlapping, and the competitive dynamics become similar to that of annuals. 6. Coexistence between annual and perennial species is promoted if the covariances between the annual survival and the relative yield of perennials, and between the yields of perennials and annuals, decrease and become more negative. 7. Selection for seed yield and establishment in different conditions in annuals favours a generalist strategy with low variance between years which provides a moderate yield and establishment over a wide range of environmental conditions. In perennial plants, long-term growth rate is determined by the lifetime seed yield and establishment. Because of strong competition with annuals in the more common conditions, selection in perennials favours instead a specialist strategy, with a high seed yield and establishment at relatively rare occasions in space and time, in which there is only weak competition with annuals. 8. Coexistence of annual species with a long-lived seed bank in the soil is also made possible by independent variation in different years of the germination, seed yield and establishment of different species, analogous to the situation of perennial plants.},

Assuming that the death rate only depends on age, the allocation of energy is the solution of an optimization problem defined by a life history model. Making particular assumptions for the individual′s potential for growth and reproduction covering many situations of biological interest, the precise solution can be written up explicitely. Hence the effect of the various parameters may be analysed in detail. In general, the individual should first use all its energy to growth, then at a certain age invest a proportion of energy into reproduction. This fraction increases as the individual grow older. In some situations growth finally stops, while for other parameter values the individual continue to grow until it dies. This model was used to examine, for the von Bertanlanffy′s growth curve, the effects on age and size at maturity of changing the age-specific mortality rates. In general, the growth changes From a determinate growth to an indeterminate growth pattern when the mortality rate increases. In particular, a strong effect was found when the juvenile mortality increased. Rapid growth was also found to favour early maturation.},

Plants are assumed to propagate both by producing seeds that scatter over the population and by vegetative reproduction by extending runners, rhizomes, or roots, to neighboring vacant sites. In addtion, the seed production rate may be dependent on the local density in the neighborhood, indicating beneficial or harmful crowding effects. Two sets of population dynamical equation(s) are derived: one based onmean-field approximation and the other based onpair approximation (tracing both global and local densities simultaneously). We examine the accuracy of these approximate dynamics by comparing them with direct computer simulation of the stochastic lattice model. Pair approximation is much more accurate than mean-field approximation. Mean-field approximation overestimates the parameter range for persistence if crowding effects on seed production are harmful or weakly beneficial, but underestimates it if crowding effects are highly beneficial. Dynamics may show bistability (both population persistence and extinction) if the effect of crowding is strongly beneficial. If there is a linear trade-off between seed production and vegetative reproduction, the equilibrium abundance of the population may be maximised by a mixture of seed production and vegetative reproduction, rather than by pure seed production or by pure vegetative reproduction. This result is correctly predicted by pair approximation but not by mean-field approximation.},

The traditional method of modelling in population ecology is either to neglect spatial pattern (e.g. in transition matrix models) or to do straightforward computer simulation. We review here three analytical mothods to deal with plant populations in a lattice-structured habitat, which propagate both by seeds that scatter over the whole habitat and by vegetative reproduction (producing runners, rhizomes, etc.) to neighboring vacant sites. [1]Dynamics of global and local densities: Dynamical equations of population density considering nearest-neighbor correlation (spatial clumping) are developed as the joint dynamics of global average density and local density (comparable to mean crowding) based onpair approximation. If there is a linear trade-off between seed production and vegetative reproduction, the equilibrium abundance of the population may be maximized by engaging both means of reproduction. This result is accurately predicted by the pair approximation method, but not by mean-field approximation (neglect of spatial structure). [2]Cluster size distributions: Using global and local densities obtained by pair approximation, we predicted cluster size distribution, i.e. the number of clusters of occupied sites of various sizes. [3]Clonal identity probability decreasing with distance: Multi-locus measurement of allozymes or other neutral molecular markers tells us whether or not a given pair of individuals belong to the same clone. From the pattern of clonal identity probability decreasing with the distance between ramets, we can estimate the relative importance of two modes of reproduction: vegetative propagation and sexual seed production.},

Here we study the optimal age-specific pattern of defense chemical concentration in leaves that achieves the maximum growth rate of the plant. We consider a plant growing exponentially in a constant environment. Assumptions are the following: (1) The loss of leaves due to herbivory decreases with defense chemical concentration (2) The daily net photosynthesis of a leaf decreases with its age. (3) Using photosynthetic products, the plant produces new leaves that may contain defense chemicals. (4) Although there is a cost to producing new defense chemicals, such chemicals can be reallocated without cost. In the optimal schedule calculated using Pontryagin's maximum principle, the chemical defense level decreases with leaf age. The optimal level of chemical defense increases with the cost of leaf production and herbivory intensity but decreases with the cost of defense chemical production, effectiveness of the defense chemical, net productivity, and growth rate of the plant. If both generalist and specialist herbivores attack the same plant, the optimal defense level is dependent only on the generalists' abundance and sensitivity, but is independent of the specialists that are unaffected by the defense chemical.},

If both plant death and population growth rates are constant, the plant strategy is dependent only on its own storage size. Conditions for the evolution of mast reproduction were analyzed under both constant and varying environments, from the view point of storage-size dependent strategy, which is influenced by three parameters: the advantage coefficient of mast seeding, β; the cost coefficient of delayed seeding, γ; and the assimilation rate, P. The model indicated that: (1) mast seeding evolves only with a greater than linear increase in reproductive success with effort (β {\textgreater} 1) under both constant and varying environments; (2) in mast seeding, a critical storage size, Sc{\textasciicircum}*, occurs, above which plants utilize all storage for reproduction; (3) in a constant environment, Sc{\textasciicircum}* increases with increasing β and P and/or decreasing γ; (4) concomitant with (3), an intermasting period, τ,also increases with increasing β and decreasing γ, but is independent of P; (5) in a varying environment, Sc{\textasciicircum}* and the average of τ increase with increasing variance of the assimilation rate, P; and (6) concomitant with (5), the intermasting period has a certain probability distribution.

	abstract = {Terrestrial plants often live in environments in which above-ground photosynthetic organs (production parts) are suddenly removed by unpredictable disturbances, such as fire, frost, desiccation, pathogen attack, breakage by wind and trampling, or herbivory by insects and mammals. We study the optimal growth schedule for a plant having a below-ground storage organ that is used for recovery (or regrowth) of photosynthetic organs after disturbances. We assume the following: (1) the daily production rate increases with the production part size, but saturates for large size due to shading and local resource depletion, (2) disturbances occur randomly and remove all the aerial parts, (3) plants are finally killed by fatal disturbances that also occur randomly and (4) the plant chooses the pattern of growth, reproduction, storage and recovery after disturbances by reallocation of stored material to maximize the total lifetime reproductive success. The model is analysed by stochastic dynamic programming. The results are as follows: (1) the ratio of storage size to production part size (S/F ratio) is large if the longevity is large and if the disturbance rate is large but a little smaller than the productivity coefficient, (2) the S/F ratio is larger for mature plants than for small immature plants, (3) after disturbances, the above-ground production part recovers relatively quickly, but reproductive activity is depressed until storage size recovers and (4) the variations over time and between habitats differing in disturbance frequency are larger for storage size and for reproductive activity than for production part size. These tendencies are more pronounced for a linear production function (with initial linear increase followed by a sudden stop), but less so for a hyperbolic production function (with a gradually decreasing slope). We also discuss the growth and regrowth behaviour of plants adapted to a disturbance frequency growing under one different disturbance frequency.},

This may be achieved by different tactics of resource use that also include foraging decisions. Two such general tactics are discussed in this paper under the concepts of capital and income breeding. These are defined mainly from the temporal distribution of resource acquisition relative to resource use. A capital breeder acquires its resources in advance and store them endogenously or exogenously until they are needed to supply aspects of offspring production. An income breeder, on the other hand, adjusts its food intake concurrently with breeding, without reliance on stores. In a perfectly predictable environment without limited resources, income breeding is the best option since capital breeders may have to pay a number of energetic and demographic costs for their stored resources. However, under unpredictable food conditions, food/time limitations, and risky foraging conditions, capital breeding offers many benefits. The costing systems (pre- or postbreeding costs) induced by capital and income breeding will largely influence the opportunity for these energetic tactics to evolve. While capital and income breeders may potentially experience both pre- and postbreeding costs, capital breeders may be more exposed to prebreeding costs due to predation in connection with acquisition and carriage of stores.},

	abstract = {The relationship between a plant and its potential enemies changes drastically after reproduction has started. Using a dynamic modelling approach we study the effects of herbivores and pathogens, that are attracted by reproducing plants, on optimal allocation of resources, and life-history strategies. We assume that the level of attack increases with the investment in reproduction, which may lead to a reduction of current years reproductive success, a reduction of storage efficiency or an increase of plant mortality. If herbivores or pathogens attracted by flowering plants mainly reduce current years reproductive success, the optimal life-history is annual or iteroparous perennial if the attack is an all or nothing event. If the level of consumption increases with the number of herbivores attracted, the optimal life-history is most likely iteroparity with or without mast years. Only under very restricted conditions this may lead to semelparity. If herbivores mainly reduce the efficiency of the resources stored for next year, the optimal life-history is iteroparity. If herbivores mainly reduce survival, the optimal solution is likely to be mast years or semelparity. For parameter values that are realistic for Cynoglossum officinale, a semelparous perennial from calcereous soils, the model predicts that reproduction should start in the third year and that 99\% of the available resources at the end of season should be invested in reproduction and only 1\% saved for growth next year. With such an investment only c. 1\% of the plants would survive after reproduction, so the optimal life-history is close to semelparity. For the small fraction of plants that reproduce more than once, years of vegetative growth only and years with reproduction should alternate. Multiple reproduction is rare in C. officinale. However, such a life history is very common for plants known as semelparous perennial. Although the available empirical evidence is, as yet, circumstantial rather than conclus ive we propose that reproduction related mortality mediated through herbivores or pathogens may play a role in the evolution of the semelparous perennial life-history.},

	abstract = {Baker's Law states that it is more likely for self-compatible than for self-incompatible individuals to establish sexually reproducing colonies after long-distance dispersal, because only the former can do so with a single individual. This hypothesis, proposed by H. G. Baker 40 years ago is based largely on the observation that self-compatibility is particularly frequent among colonists of oceanic islands. Here we argue that the principle of Baker's Law applies equally in the context of a metapopulation in which frequent local extinction is balanced by recolonization of sites by seed dispersal: metapopulation dynamics will select for an ability to self-fertilize. We review several studies that support this hypothesis and present a metapopulation model in which the seed productivity required by obligate outcrossers for their maintenance in a metapopulation is compared with that of selfers. Our model also estimates the reduction in the advantage of reproductive assurance to selfers as a result of perenniality and seed dormancy. In general, selection for reproductive assurance is greatest when the colony occupancy rate, p, is low and is much reduced when p approaches its maximum. This provides an explanation for the observation that many highly successful colonizers, in which p is often high, are self-incompatible.

Therefore, it is argued that selection for a determinate strategy may be too weak to overwhelm random processes like environmental stochasticity or genetic drift that shape patterns of growth, especially under low mortality. The consequences of an indeterminate strategy for optimal size at maturity and final size were investigated: prolonging the period in which growth and reproduction co-occurred decreased size at maturity only slightly but markedly increased the final size.},

The vertical structure of the world's vegetation, which is inefficient for plant growth, can then be understood as the outcome of evolutionary and ecological arms races. In addition, game-theoretic models predict taller vegetation on sites of higher leaf area index, and allocation to reproduction only after an initial period of height growth. However, of 14 game-theoretic models for height reviewed here, only one predicts coexistence of a mix of height strategies, a conspicuous feature of most vegetation. We suggest that game-theoretic models could help account for observed mixtures of height strategies if they incorporated processes for coexistence along spectra of light income and time since disturbance.},

The central point of their model is a mixed state-control constraint on the rate of reproductive growth, which leads to a mixed vegetative–reproductive growth period. Their model is modified here in order to take into account the difference of photosynthesis use efficiency when energy is accumulated in the vegetative and in the reproductive organs of a plant, respectively. The simple assumption on correlation between photosynthesis and temperature permits us to modify the model in a form that is useful for changing climate. Unfortunately, the mathematical solution of the optimal control problem in Kozłowsky and Ziółko (1988) and Ziółko and Kozłowski (1995) is incorrect. The strict mathematical solution is presented here, the numerical example from Kozłowski and Ziółko (1988) is solved, and the results are compared. The influence of the length of the season and the relative photosynthesis use efficiency, as well as of the potential sink demand of the reproductive organs, on the location and duration of the mixed vegetative–reproduction period of growth is investigated numerically. The results show that the mixed growth period is increased and shifted toward the end of the season when the lengths of the season is increased.

Moreover, we discuss the connection between the time interval of the discrete-time dynamic model and the ability of the plant to rebuild completely its vegetative body (from reserves). We formulate a stochastic optimization problem covering the so-called linear and logarithmic fitness (corresponding to variation within and between years), which yields optimal strategies. For ``linear maximizers'', we analyse how optimal strategies depend upon the environmental variability type: constant, random stationary, random i.i.d., random monotonous. We provide general patterns in terms of targets and thresholds, including both determinate and indeterminate growth. We also provide a partial result on the comparison between ``linear maximizers'' and ``log maximizers''. Numerical simulations are provided, allowing to give a hint at the effect of different mathematical assumptions.},

We constructed a mathematical model using Pontryargin's maximum principle to investigate changes in flowering time by examining shifts in resource allocation from vegetative to reproductive plant components. We represented a primary production of a plant individual by two types of function of vegetative part size, a linear function and a convex non-linear function. The results of a linear production model indicate that optimal phenology follows a schedule that switches from the production of vegetative parts to that of reproductive parts at a given time (‘bang–bang’ control). However, in a non-linear model, a singular control, wherein the plant invests in both productive and reproductive parts, may be included between obligate production and reproduction periods. We assumed that the peak of the flowering season occurs immediately following the exclusive investment in reproduction. In a linear production model, differential herbivory rates on the vegetative and reproductive parts of a plant resulted in shifts in the peak flowering time. A higher herbivory rate on the vegetative components advanced the peak, whereas it was delayed when grazing pressure focused on reproductive components of the plant. In the non-linear production model, increased grazing pressure tended to postpone the flowering peak. These results corresponded well with results of enclosure experiments, thus suggesting adaptive control of flowering time in plants.},

Different kinds of tropisms were implemented as stochastic processes that determine the position of the different roots in space.

In order to reduce damage from herbivory, plants evolve antiherbivore defenses, the mechanisms of which have been studied from a theoretical viewpoint. In the theoretical studies, the models of defense schedules have assumed a uniform intensity of herbivory or a constant rate of encounter of herbivores throughout the season. However, some herbivores apparently appear for only a limited period instead of the whole growing season of the plant. In our study, we analyzed the optimal schedule of defense allocation of the plant under the herbivory that occurs within a limited period with a certain probability. We assumed an annual plant that consists of vegetative and defensive parts and whose growing season is divided into two phases at the time of herbivore emergence. In the phase after the emergence time, the status of a plant can be either with or without herbivore stochastically. The plant is considered to maximize the average vegetative size at the end of the growing season. We found that under the fixed emergence time, inducible defense is favored when the plant growth rate and herbivory intensity are high. Extending this result, we also analyzed the coevolution of plant defense and herbivore emergence time by using invasibility analysis. In the system considered, an equilibrium steady state tends to be absent in herbivore strategy. This suggests polymorphism of herbivore emergence time.},

The conducted experiments focus on the evolutionary emergence of different life history strategies in an environment with heterogeneous resource availability and disturbance frequency. It is found that, depending on the encountered conditions, the plants develop three major strategies classified as competitors, stress-tolerators and ruderals according to Grime's \{CSR\} theory. Most of the evolved characteristics comply with theoretical biology or field observations on natural plants. Besides these results, our modelling framework is highly flexible and many refinements can be readily implemented depending on the issues one intends to address.

	abstract = {1. Numerous plant traits are known to influence aspects of individual performance, including rates of carbon uptake, tissue turnover, mortality and fecundity. These traits are bound to influence emergent properties of vegetation because quantities such as leaf-area cover, average height, primary productivity and density of standing biomass result from the collective behaviour of individuals. Yet, little is known about the influence of individual traits on these emergent properties, despite the widespread use in current vegetation models of plant functional types, each of which is defined by a constellation of traits.

2. We examine the influence of four key traits (leaf economic strategy, height at maturation, wood density, and seed size) on four emergent vegetation properties (average height of leaf area, leaf-area index, net primary productivity and biomass density). We employ a trait-, size- and patch-structured model of vegetation dynamics that allows scaling up from individual-level growth processes and probabilistic disturbances to landscape-level predictions. A physiological growth model incorporating relevant trade-offs was designed and calibrated based on known empirical patterns. The resulting vegetation model naturally exhibits a range of phenomena commonly observed in vegetation dynamics.

3. We modelled single-species stands, varying each trait over its known empirical range. Seed size had only a small effect on vegetation properties, primarily because our metapopulations were not seed-limited. The remaining traits all had larger effects on vegetation properties, especially on biomass density. Leaf economic strategy influenced minimum light requirement, and thus total leaf area and basal area. Wood density and height at maturation influenced vegetation mainly by modifying individual stem mass. These effects of traits were maintained, and sometimes amplified, across stands differing in productivity and mean disturbance interval.

4. Synthesis: Natural trait variation can cause large differences in emergent properties of vegetation, the magnitudes of which approach those arising through changes to site productivity and disturbance frequency. Our results therefore underscore the need for next-generation vegetation models that incorporate functional traits together with their effects on the patch and size structure of vegetation.},

	abstract = {Reproduction timing is one of the most important factors for the life history because it is closely related to subsistence of species. On the other hand, ecological demographers recently noted the effects of environmental stochasticity on the population dynamics by using linear demographic models because stochasticity reduces the population growth rate. Linear demographic models are generally composed of reproduction timing, several life history traits and stochasticity. The stochasticity is generated by twofold stochasticity, that is, internal and external stochasticities. In transition matrix models, the internal stochasticity gives a species a set of transition probabilities to other states, whereas the external stochasticity annually variegates the value of these transition probabilities. If the population vector has only the internal stochasticity, it satisfies a partial differential equation, in which it is described by a stochasticity in body-size growth rate.

In this paper, we focus on the stochasticity which affects the body-size growth rate under r-selection. We construct a mathematical model of stochastic life history of each individual by using a stochastic differential equation, and analyze the relationship between optimal life schedule and the population dynamics by finding Euler–Lotka equation. Then, we use the formalism of path-integral expression to the population dynamics and show that the expression is consistent with other expressions in linear demographic models. Finally, we apply our method to a simple example, and obtain a characteristic of the stochasticity which has not only negative effect on the fitness but also positive effect from our model.},

Examples considered include the seasonal timing of reproduction of annual plants, growth schedules over multiple seasons in perennials, growth in environments where herbivory or fire may remove the photosynthetic system, and the optimal level of chemical defence against herbivory.},

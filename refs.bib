  doi = {10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.03.023},
  abstract = {We present a novel optimal allocation model for perennial plants, in which assimilates are not allocated directly to vegetative or reproductive parts but instead go first to a storage compartment from where they are then optimally redistributed. We do not restrict considerations purely to periods favourable for photosynthesis, as it was done in published models of perennial species, but analyse the whole life period of a perennial plant. As a result, we obtain the general scheme of perennial plant development, for which annual and monocarpic strategies are special cases.

We not only re-derive predictions from several previous optimal allocation models, but also obtain more information about plants׳ strategies during transitions between favourable and unfavourable seasons. One of the model׳s predictions is that a plant can begin to re-establish vegetative tissues from storage some time before the beginning of favourable conditions, which in turn allows for better production potential when conditions become better. By means of numerical examples we show that annual plants with single or multiple reproduction periods, monocarps, evergreen perennials and polycarpic perennials can be studied successfully with the help of our unified model.

Finally, we build a bridge between optimal allocation models and models describing trade-offs between size and the number of seeds: a modelled plant can control the distribution of not only allocated carbohydrates but also seed size. We provide sufficient conditions for the optimality of producing the smallest and largest seeds possible.},

  abstract = {The development of perennial grains has the potential to provide environmentally sound, economically viable alternatives for use on erodible land where annual crop production is not sustainable. The concept of perennial grain production is not new. Historically, seeds of perennial grasses have been used as grain by various human cultures. In this paper, efforts to develop perennial grain crops which were initiated during the 20th century are discussed. These include attempts by the Soviets and Europeans to perennialize annual grains such as wheat and rye. More recently, efforts in the U.S. inspired by the publication of Dr. Wes Jackson's book, New Roots for Agriculture,1,2 have focused upon the domestication of perennial grass species. The advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches to perennial grain development are discussed. Specific examples are given with the hope that future efforts can benefit from experiences of the past and present.},

  abstract = {In the course of their evolution, the angiosperms have radiated into most known plant forms and life histories. Their adaptation to a recently created habitat, the crop field, produced a novel form: the plant that allocates an unprecedented 30–60\% of its net productivity to sexual structures. Long-lived trees, shrubs and vines of this form evolved, as did annual herbs. Perennial herb forms with increased allocation to asexual reproduction evolved, but there are no examples of perennial herbs with high sexual effort. We suggest that sowing seed into annually tilled fields favored shorter-lived herbs because of trade-offs between first-year seed production and relative growth rate and/or persistence. By propagating cuttings, people quickly domesticated tuber crops and large woody plants. Perennial herbs were too small to be efficiently propagated by cuttings, and the association between longevity, allogamy and genetic load made rapid domestication by sexual cycles unlikely. Perennial grain crops do not exist because they could not have evolved under the original set of conditions; however, they can be deliberately developed today through artificial phenotypic and genotypic selection.},

  abstract = {In plants, investment in height improves access to light, but incurs costs in construction and maintenance of the stem. Because the benefits of plant height depend on which other height strategies are present, competition for light can usefully be framed as a game-theoretic problem. The vertical structure of the world's vegetation, which is inefficient for plant growth, can then be understood as the outcome of evolutionary and ecological arms races. In addition, game-theoretic models predict taller vegetation on sites of higher leaf area index, and allocation to reproduction only after an initial period of height growth. However, of 14 game-theoretic models for height reviewed here, only one predicts coexistence of a mix of height strategies, a conspicuous feature of most vegetation. We suggest that game-theoretic models could help account for observed mixtures of height strategies if they incorporated processes for coexistence along spectra of light income and time since disturbance.},

  abstract = {The nutrient (N, P) use efficiency (NUE: g g- 1nutrient), measured for the entire plant, of field populations of the evergreen shrubs Erica tetralix (in a wet heathland) and Calluna vulgaris (in a dry heathland) and the deciduous grass Molinia caerulea (both in a wet and a dry heathland) was compared. Erica and Calluna are crowded out by Molinia when nutrient availability increases. NUE was measured as the product of the mean residence time of a unit of nutrient in the population (MRT: yr) and nutrient productivity (A: annual productivity per unit of nutrient in the population, g g-{\textasciitilde}nutrient yr-1). It was hypothesized that 1) in low-nutrient habitats selection is on features leading to a high MRT, whereas in high-nutrient habitats selection is on features leading to a high A; and that 2) due to evolutionary trade-offs plants cannot combine genotypically determined features which maximize both components of NUE.},

  abstract = {To determine whether autumnal nutrient resorption contributes significantly to plant fitness, resorption was prevented by defoliating scrub oak (Quercus ilicifolia) plants ("defoliated plants") just prior to the onset of foliar senescence in the years 1985 through 1987. At the same time, to account for the potential influence of the reduced photosynthetic season on defoliated plants, another group ("shaded plants") was subjected to darkness, resulting in senescence in the absence of concomitant photosynthesis. In 1988, senescence and abscission were allowed to proceed normally in all study plants. In the three years that followed treatment years, 1986-1988, radial stem growth and yearly increases in foliar biomass of defoliated plants averaged 41 and 54\% less than in controls. Acorn production in defoliated plants in 1989 was only 10\% of that in either controls or shaded plants. In contrast to such marked responses in growth and reproduction, content of nitrogen, phosphorus, copper, manganese, and zinc in presenescent (green) leaves exhibited little response to defoliation in the previous year. In 1988, when resorption efficiencies could be measured in plants previously subjected to defoliation, there were no significant differences between control and defoliated plants for nitrogen, copper, manganese, or zinc. The efficiency of phosphorus resorption was 10\% lower in defoliated plants. In shaded plants, resorption efficiencies of nitrogen, phosphorus, and copper, but not of manganese and zinc, were substantially reduced relative to controls in treatment years, indicating both quantitative and qualitative differences between dark-induced and normal senescence. The significant negative effects on growth and reproduction that resulted from preventing resorption in Q. ilicifolia offer strong support for the hypothesis that resorption contributes significantly to plant fitness.},

Plant growth was enhanced in high-nutrient treatments, leading to higher concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in leaves and ears. Water stress reduced growth, but plants in waterstressed treatments had equal or higher nutrient concentrations than watered plants. Nutrient resorption efficiency was higher at low than at high nutrient availability, and was higher in watered than in water-stressed plants. Treatments in which sink strength was increased had enhanced resorption efficiency, as well as those in which the source activity was reduced. Our data show that the amount of nutrient resorbed and the efficiency of the resorption process depend on plant nutrient and water status, and that the presence of an active sink strongly enhances nutrient resorption.},

An intuitive justification of optimization procedures used in Pontryagin's maximum principle is obtained by defining the marginal values of shoot size, root size, and reproductive activity at various times of the season and deriving their differential equations and terminal conditions. The optimal growth pattern which maximizes the total reproductive activity during the season is composed of the convergence of a plant's shape to a balanced growth path, followed by simultaneous growth of shoot and root (balanced growth), ending with the reproductive growth. Along the balanced growth path, a plant has a root/shoot ratio which maximizes the daily net photosynthesis for a given total biomass. The model also shows a simultaneous stop of shoot and root growth when the reproduction begins, the dependence of root/shoot ratio on age, water and light availability, etc., the convergence of a plant's shape to the balanced growth after pruning or an environmental change.},

  title    = {Optimal growth schedule of a perennial plant},
  url      = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2462084},
  abstract = {The optimal growth schedule of a deciduous perennial plant is studied theoretically. We make three basic assumptions. First, the daily net photosynthetic rate of a plant increases but saturates with the size of the production part (vegetative organs working for photosynthesis). Second, the production part is discarded at the end of a growing season, but it may be rebuilt at the beginning of the next season using stored material. And finally, the plant maximizes the lifetime reproductive investment by choosing both the growth schedule within each season and the resource allocation between reproduction for the year and storage for the next season. The model is analyzed by the combination of maximum principle and dynamic programming. Our analysis showed three basic results. First, the annual life cycle is optimal under low storage efficiency, low habitat reliability, low growth rate, and a short growing season. Second, under any other conditions, perennial growth is optimal. During years in which the final amount of resources is smaller than a critical value S*, the plant remains immature and saves all of the resources for the next season. If it becomes larger than S*, the plant invests the excess in reproductive activities and repeats the same growth schedule thereafter (steady state). Finally, reproductive effort (the ratio of reproductive investment to total annual production) of a mature plant is high for an annual, is lowest for a perennial just above the threshold for the perennial growth pattern, increases as the length of the season increases, and in a very productive habitat may even exceed the level for an annual. The ratio of the plant size established by stored material to the maximum plant size decreases with the length of the growing season, which quantitatively fits the available data. In light of the model, reported growth patterns and leaf phenology of many deciduous plants indicate that the nonlinearity of photosynthetic rate as a function of the size of the production part is important. For a case with nonlinear photosynthesis but without an upper limit to the leaf expansion rate, a plant's optimal phenology, if normalized by size, can be parameterized by two quantities: productivity (maximum relative growth rate multiplied by a season's length) and stability (annual survival multiplied by storage efficiency). The timing of the cessation of leaf production within a season by a small immature plant is determined by productivity (occurring later in a more productive habitat). Leaf production ends earlier in the season as the plant grows. The optimal time for ending leaf production in a mature plant, in contrast, is controlled mainly by stability (it ceases earlier at a more stable site) and is almost independent of productivity.},

\tableofcontents

An organism's life history is the sequence of events related to survival and reproduction that occur from birth through death. Considered another way, an organism's life history is the time series of how it allocates energy over its lifespan. We expect that, on average, the allocations an organism makes are shaped over evolutionary time to maximize reproductive fitness.

In modeling life history, we would like to recover a policy function $\pi(X,t)$ which, given the organism's current allocations and anticipated future needs $X$, determines how incoming energy at time $t$ should be allocated. Finding such a function is challenging and the field has typically relied on optimal control theory and applications of Pontryagin's maximum principle to do so. This has required increasing mathematical sophistication over time~\citep{mirmirani_competition_1978, iwasa_optimal_1989, pugliese_optimal_1990, mironchenko_optimal_2014}. This paper recasts previous theory in the form of convex optimization problems which can be solved numerically. This has several advantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lower barriers to entry. Applying optimal control theory requires significant mathematical sophistication. This barrier to entry makes it unnecessarily challenging for ecologists to include theory in their work.
\item Faster ideation and exploration. Even for those who have mastered the techniques of optimal control theory, applying it to a particular case can still be time-consuming and seemingly simple modifications to a model can rapidly move it into the realm of intractibility. The techniques here make it easy to investigate model variants quickly.
\item Powerful solvers. The techniques presented here rely on a powerful toolbox of solvers which can quickly find optimal numerical solutions to even large problems. This means that instantiating seemingly complex problems in computer code is easy, even for beginners.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

The basic idea behind \textit{mathematical programming} is that we will specify an \textit{objective function} whose value we wish to minimize (or maximize) by setting the values of a set of \textit{decision variables} whose values are subject to \textit{constraints} which combine the decision variables and \textit{parameters} using standard mathematical functions and either inequalities ($<,\le,\ge,>$) or equalities ($=$). Once the objective and constraints have been specified, we can pass the problem off to software to determine the optimal values.

Unfortunately, except for special cases, solving such problems is extremely hard. Fortunately, the special cases are vast and include many problems of interest. We discuss some of them here moving from the most- to least-constrained problem space, as shown in \autoref{fig:hierarchy}.



The basic idea behind \textit{convex programming} is that if our objective and constraints all consist of convex functions, then the resulting problem can almost always be solved reliably and quickly. If the problem is non-convex, then even powerful software may be unable to find a good answer in a reasonable amount of time.

%TODO: Tutorial on convex programming http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~janm/Papers_RG/Hindi_ConfAC_Jul04.pdf

A convex function $f(x)$ is any function having the property that a line originating anywhere within the domain bounded by the function can reach any other point without passing outside of the domain. A (idealized) potato is a convex function; a banana is not.

If we consider the simplest convex case---linear programming---the intuition becomes clear. In such a problem the potato is constructed of intersecting Euclidean planes. Since we are constraining ourselves to convex situations, the potato does not have any divets. The objective function can be thought of as a series of isolines along each of which the objective function has a constant value even as the decision variables change. With some thought, you can see that there is a maximum to the objective function which occurs on an isoline tangent the potato, though more than one set of values for the decision variables might yield this maximum. A simple procedure---known as the simplex method---for finding this maximum is to:
(1)~find a vertex at the intersection of the planes defining the potato,
(2)~consider all neighbouring vertices and move to the one with the highest objective value,
(3)~repeated step (2) until no vertex has a higher objective---this is the maximum.

\section{Life History Problems}
\label{sec:problems}


\subsection{What is the optimal single-season growth strategy?}
\label{sec:mirmirani1978-single}

\citet{mirmirani_competition_1978} pose the following problem: consider a plant whose life cycle plays out over a single season of length $T$. Let $P(t)$ be the plant's biomass at time $t$ starting at an initial value of $P(0)=P_0$ (the seed weight). During the season the plant can choose to allocate its resources (photosynthate) to make more biomass (increasing its growth rate) or it can allocate resources to reproductive biomass $S(t)$ (seeds) which directly increase its reproductive fitness. If the supply of resources is constant, what is the optimal reproductive strategy of the plant?

We can formalize the problem like so:
\begin{maxi}|s|
{u(t)}{S(T)}
{}{}
\addConstraint{\dot{P}}{=\hat{r}u(t)P-\mu P}
\addConstraint{\dot{S}}{=\tilde{r}(1-u(t))P-\nu S}
\addConstraint{P,S}{\ge 0}
\addConstraint{P(0)}{=P_0}
\addConstraint{S(0)}{=0}
\addConstraint{u(t)}{\in[0,1]}
\end{maxi}
where $\hat{r}$ and $\tilde{r}$ are conversion efficiencies, $\mu$ and $\nu$ are loss of biomass (perhaps by grazing, tissue senescence, or seed predation), and $u$ is a \textit{control variable} bound to the range $[0,1]$ indicating a hard trade-off between incoming energy (photosynthate) being allocated to productive versus reproductive tissues.

\citet{mirmirani_competition_1978} show how to solve this problem using techniques from optimal control theory; in order to solve it as a mathematical program, we need to make a few changes which will be standard for the rest of this paper. Our first step is to \textbf{discretize the problem} using the forward Euler method (see \autoref{sec:euler}) this gives the following system:
\begin{maxi}|s|
  {u(t)}{S(T)}
  {}{}
  \addConstraint{P_{t+1}}{=P_t+\Delta t\left(\hat{r}u_tP_t-\mu P_t\right)}{~~\forall t}
  \addConstraint{S_{t+1}}{=S_t+\Delta t\left(\tilde{r}(1-u_t)P_t-\nu S_t\right)}{~~\forall t}
  \addConstraint{P_t,S_t}{\ge 0}{~~\forall t}
  \addConstraint{P_{t=0}}{=P_0}
  \addConstraint{S_{t=0}}{=0}
  \addConstraint{u_t}{\in[0,1]}{~~\forall t}
\end{maxi}
where $\Delta t$ a constant scalar representing the length of the time interval between any two time points $t$ and $t+1$.

Next, we need to \textbf{add a dimension to the control}. In our current system $u_tP_t$ and $(1-u_t)P_t$ are both products of variables. From \autoref{sec:mathprog}, we recognize these as forming at least a quadratic system, which is hard to solve; if we retain the product we also have to worry about the convexity of the system. It is best to eliminate such products where we can. In this case, it is easy to do so. Our strategy will be to add a new control variable (equivalent to adding a dimension to the control vector) and require that the control vector sum to the incoming energy ($P_t$, in this case) at each timestep. This gives
\begin{maxi}|s|
  {u(t)}{S(T)}
  {}{}
  \addConstraint{P_{t+1}}{=P_t+\Delta t\left(\hat{r}u_{1,t}-\mu P_t\right)}{~~\forall t}
  \addConstraint{S_{t+1}}{=S_t+\Delta t\left(\tilde{r}u_{2,t}-\nu S_t\right)}{~~\forall t}
  \addConstraint{P_t,S_t}{\ge 0}{~~\forall t}
  \addConstraint{P_{t=0}}{=P_0}
  \addConstraint{S_{t=0}}{=0}
  \addConstraint{u_{1,t}+u_{2,t}}{=P_t}{~~\forall t}
\end{maxi}
From \autoref{sec:mathprog}, we recognize this as an LP and therefore know that it can be solved reliably and quickly. In this paper's modeling language the problem instantiates as:

\inputminted[firstline=3,frame=single,linenos]{python}{src/MirmiraniOster1978_single_season.py}

Solving this gives the result shown in \autoref{fig:MirmiraniOster1978_single_season}. The growth pattern of the plant shows that initially all growth is allocated to the vegetative tissue with a smooth transition to vegetative tissue later in the growing season. The plant's vegetative tissue begins to decline in mass at that point due to the non-zero value of $\mu$ indicating tissue senescence or predation. %TODO: Why does our control pattern differ from Mirmirani's?

\subsection{When should a plant flower?}
\label{sec:iwasa2000flower}
%TODO: Iwasa seems to have listed the wrong parameter values as evidenced by integrating g(F) from 0 to 4

\citet{Iwasa2000} considers the question of when a plant should flower, a problem first address by Cohen (1971, 1976). %TODO
Let $F(t)$ be the plant's vegetative biomass (leaves, stems and roots) and daily production (photosynthesis minus respiration) be modeled by
\begin{equation}
g(F)=\frac{aF}{1+hF}
\end{equation}
a saturating function such as this is desirable because it captures effects such as self-shading and local resource depression. Production can be allocated either to increasing vegetative biomass or reproductive biomass $R$ according to a \textit{control variable} $u(t)$. We therefore wish to solve the problem
\begin{maxi}|s|
{u(t)}{R(T)}
{}{}
\addConstraint{\dot{F}}{=(1-u)g(F)}
\addConstraint{\dot{R}}{=u g(F)}
\addConstraint{F,R}{\ge 0}
\addConstraint{F(0)}{=F_0}
\addConstraint{R(0)}{=0}
\addConstraint{u(t)}{\in[0,1]}
\end{maxi}

As usual, we will discretize and add a dimension to the control variable; however, our growth function $g(F)$ is nonlinear. We have two ways of dealing with this. Since the growth function shares a form with the Michaelis--Menten kinetics equation, we can use techniques described in \autoref{sec:mmkinetics} to convert the growth function into an SOCP constraint at the cost of some computational speed. Alternatively, we could convert the function into a piecewise-linear representation using techniques described in \autoref{sec:linearlambda}, at the cost of some accuracy. If we take the former route, our final program is:
\begin{maxi}|s|
  {u(t)}{R(T)}
  {}{}
  \addConstraint{F_{t+1}}{=F_t + \Delta t \cdot u_{t,1}}{~~\forall t}
  \addConstraint{R_{t+1}}{=R_t + \Delta t \cdot u_{t,2}}{~~\forall t}
  \addConstraint{F_t,R_t}{\ge 0}{~~\forall t}
  \addConstraint{F_{t=0}}{=F_0}
  \addConstraint{R_{t=0}}{=0}
  \addConstraint{u_{t,1} + u_{t,2}}{=g_t}{~~\forall t}
  \addConstraint{\left\lVert \begin{bmatrix} (a/h) F_t \\ (1/h) g_t \\ (a/h)(1/h) \end{bmatrix} \right\rVert_2}{\le (a/h)(1/h) + (a/h) F_t - (1/h) g_t}{~~\forall t}
\end{maxi}

While the mathematics here may seem complex, the simple Python-based modeling language we've designed for this paper makes the problem easy to express:

\inputminted[firstline=3,frame=single,linenos]{python}{src/Iwasa2000_when_flower.py}


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4in]{imgs/iwasa2000_when_flower.pdf}
  \caption{The result of running the model described in \autoref{sec:iwasa2000flower} using the parameter values $a=0.1, h=1, T=8, F(0)=0.5$, following~\citep{Iwasa2000}. The control variables are normalized. \label{fig:iwasa2000flower}}
\end{figure}

The result of evaluating this model is shown in \autoref{fig:iwasa2000flower}. Analyzing the output, we see that the normalized control variables take values of either zero or one; this behaviour is called a ``bang--bang'' control. All of the plant's energy is initially used to build additional vegetative tissue (capital production); at the appropriate time all production is switched to building reproductive tissues (e.g., flowering).





\subsection{Shoot--root balance}
\label{sec:shootroot}

%TODO: Clarify
Another problem from~\citep{Iwasa1984}. Let $X_1$, $X_2$, and $R$ be the shoot, root, and accumulated reproductive biomass of a plant within a single growing season. Daily photosynthesis $g(X_1, X_2)$ will increase with the shoot biomass $X_1$ because more leaves means more photosynthesis; it will also increase with the root biomass $X_2$ because more roots means more water and nutrients. But if insufficient resources are devoted to either leaves or roots, then the plant's growth as a whole will be retarded. We can formalize the problem as:
\begin{maxi}|s|
{u(t)}{R(T)}
{}{}
\addConstraint{\dot{X_1}}{=u_1 g(X_1,X_2)}
\addConstraint{\dot{X_2}}{=u_2 g(X_1,X_2)}
\addConstraint{\dot{R}}{=u_3 g(X_1,X_2)}
\addConstraint{X_1,X_2,R}{\ge 0}
\addConstraint{u_1+u_2+u_3}{=1}
\addConstraint{X_1(0)}{=X_{1,0}}
\addConstraint{X_2(0)}{=X_{2,0}}
\addConstraint{R(0)}{=0}
\addConstraint{u_0,u_1,u_2}{\in[0,1]}
\end{maxi}
where
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:iwasa-gx1x2}
g(X_1,X_2)=\frac{1}{(a_1/LX_1^{b_1})+(a_2/WX_2^{b_2})}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the light intensity and $W$ is the soil moisture.

If we let the shoot $S$ be $X_1$ and the root $T$ be $X_2$ then we can transform the problem as follows:
\begin{maxi}|s|
  {u(t)}{R(T)}
  {}{}
  \addConstraint{S_{t+1}}{=S_t + \Delta t \cdot u_1 }
  \addConstraint{T_{t+1}}{=T_t + \Delta t \cdot u_2 }
  \addConstraint{R_{t+1}}{=R_t + \Delta t \cdot u_3 }
  \addConstraint{S,T,R}{\ge 0}
  \addConstraint{u_1+u_2+u_3}{=g(S,T)}
  \addConstraint{S_{t=0}}{=S_0}
  \addConstraint{T_{t=0}}{=T_0}
  \addConstraint{R_{t=0}}{=0}
\end{maxi}

\end{figure}

%TODO: Improve discussion here. Point out that we are only justified in doing this because of the low error involved
This problem is straight-forward except for \autoref{equ:iwasa-gx1x2}, which is non-convex (\autoref{equ:iwasa-gx1x2-splot}). We can see this easily by plotting a cross-section where $X_1=0.5$ as shown in \autoref{equ:iwasa-gx1x2-plot}. To handle this situation, we sample the function $g(X_1, X_2)$ in the range $X_1=[0,X_{1,M}]$ and $X_2=[0,X_{2,M}]$ for some large values of $X_{1,M}$ and $X_{2,M}$ (\autoref{fig:iwasa-hull}a) and wrap the resulting point cloud in a convex hull (\autoref{fig:iwasa-hull}b). This returns a set of triangle simplices containing the function. Each simplex is associated with a normal vector and an offset. If we eliminate those simplices whose normal vectors have negative $z$ components this eliminates all the simplices beneath $g(\cdot)$ (\autoref{fig:iwasa-hull}c). The remaining simplices form an upper bound for $g(\cdot)$. The normals of the simplices can then be used to define a set of hyperplanes expressing this upper bound in a form amenable to mathematical programming.

\end{figure}

All this results in a large linear program which presents a formidable challenge for cvxpy's compiler. Therefore, we use Julia to gain additional performance. Following \citep{Iwasa1984}, we choose parameter values of $a_1=2, a_2=60, b_1=0.5, b_2=2,L=1,W=1, X_{1,0}=1, X_{2,0}=2.5$ to get the following program. Running it gives us the result shown in \autoref{fig:shootroot-result}.

%TODO: Add a section on separable problems.
%TODO: Add a section with more detail on piecewise approximations
%TODO: Add a section on mixed-integer linear programs
%TODO: Add a section on SOS2 constraints





%We address the problem in stages. First, we notice that the problem is not easily separable. We fix that by using neural networks to learn a separable representation of the problem using the techniques discussed in TODO. Next, we develop piecewise linear approximations of the separable representations we have learned, using the techniques discussed in TODO. Since the growth function $g$ is non-convex the SOS2 condition used in the piecewise linear approximations is not automagically satisfied, so the problem becomes a mixed-integer linear program. Nonetheless, the problem is not challenging for modern solvers.

 %TODO: See paper for back reference that might give more parameter values






\subsection{A Single Species Living Over Multiple Seasons}
\label{sec:iwasa989-multi}

\citet{Iwasa1989} present a model of a plant which can live for $n$ growing seasons ($0\le n \le\infty$), each of length $T$. The plant's vegetative tissue $F$ is the sole input to its growth function
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:iwasa1989-g}
g(F)=\frac{fF}{1+hF}
\end{equation}
where $f$ and $h$ are constants; this is the same function discussed in \autoref{sec:iwasa2000flower}. Growth is constrained such that
\begin{equation}
0\le \dot{F}\le a F_n+b
\end{equation}

The plant also has a storage tissue $S$ which encompasses bulbs, tubers, rhizomes, and similar structures which retain energy and nutrients between growing seasons, though some fraction $1-\gamma$ of this tissue is lost between growing seasons. At the end of growing season $n$ a portion $0\le R_N \le S_n$ of the storage tissue can retroactively be declared reproductive tissue.

A plausible model of growth in a single season is then
\begin{maxi}|s|
{u(t)}{S(T)}
{}{}
\addConstraint{\dot{F}}{= u(t)(aF+b)}
\addConstraint{\dot{S}}{= g(F) - u(t)(aF+b)}
\addConstraint{F(0)}{= 0}
\addConstraint{S(0)}{= S_0}
\addConstraint{F,S}{\ge 0}
\addConstraint{u(t)}{\in [0,1]}
\end{maxi}
Note that this allows biomass to move from $S$ to $F$, since $g(F)$ enters the model as an addition to $S$ and $u(t)(aF+b)$ subracts from the combined pool of $S$ and $g(F)$. Since this models a single season maximizing $S(T)$ is the same as maximizing the reproductive tissue.

To construct the multi-season model, we link single-season models together:
\begin{align}
F_n(0)     &= 0               \\
S_{n+1}(0) &= \gamma (S_{n}(T)-R_n) \\
R_n(0)     &= 0
\end{align}

The plant attempts to maximize its lifetime reproductive output:
\begin{equation}
R_\textrm{net} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \sigma^n R_n
\end{equation}
where $0<\sigma<1$ combines the annual survival rate with any future discounting. Note that if $R_1=S_1(T)$ after optimization, then the model is indicating an annual life strategy. Similarly, if $R_2=S_2(T)$, then the plant is biennial; otherwise, the strategy is perennial.

After discretization and application of the techniques in \autoref{sec:mmkinetics} to \autoref{equ:iwasa1989-g} we get the following mathematical program:
\begin{maxi}|s|
{u(t)}{\sum_{n=0}^Y \sigma^n R_n}
{}{}
\addConstraint{F_{n,t+1}}{= F_{n,t} + \Delta t \cdot u_{n,t}}
\addConstraint{S_{n,t+1}}{= S_{n,t} + \Delta t \left( g_{n,t} - u_{n,t} \right)}
\addConstraint{\left\lVert \begin{bmatrix} (f/h) F_t \\ (1/h) g_{n,t} \\ (f/h)(1/h) \end{bmatrix} \right\rVert_2}{\le (f/h)(1/h) + (f/h) F_t - (1/h) g_{n,t}}{~~\forall t}
\addConstraint{F_{n,0}}{= 0}
\addConstraint{S_{0,0}}{= S_0}
\addConstraint{S_{n+1,0}}{= \gamma (S_{n,T}-R_n)}
\addConstraint{F,S,R}{\ge 0}
\addConstraint{u_{n,t}}{\ge0}
\addConstraint{u_{n,t}}{\le aF_{n,t}+b}
\end{maxi}
Though we would like $Y=\infty$, our mathematical modeling framework cannot handle this. However, this is not a severe restriction. Consider a relatively large value for $\sigma$ such as 0.85. After 10 years the discount rate is 0.19 and, after 20 years, it has become 0.038. That is, the plant's reproductive value 20 years out is worth only 3.8\% of the value of the plant's reproductive output during its first year of life. $\sigma$ is necessarily greater than zero, otherwise the plant has no incentive to grow; $\sigma$ is also necessarily less than one because the future is risky and no plant can guarantee its survival.

\end{figure}

In this paper's modeling language the problem instantiates as:

\inputminted[firstline=3,frame=single,linenos]{python}{src/Iwasa1989_multi_season.py}

Solving this gives the result shown in \autoref{fig:iwasa1989-multi}. The growth pattern of the plant shows that during its first year of life it preserves about half of its storage to jump-start growth in subsequent years. During the next few years, the plant enters a recurring pattern which is only broken during the last year when the finite time horizon cause it to put all of its energy into reproduction. The plant's control variable is again bang-bang.

\subsection{Two Species Competing In A Single Season}

%TODO: Better explain the motivation for the following equations

\citet{mirmirani_competition_1978} explore two species competing in a single season. Let the biomass of the vegetative parts of the plants be $P_1$ and $P_2$, the biomass of the reproductive tissues $S_1$ and $S_2$, $E_1$ and $E_2$ the strength of the competitive interactions, and $r_1$ and $r_2$ are assimilation constants. The growth of the plants can then be modeled as (\citep[Eq.\ 4--1 -- 4--4]{mirmirani_competition_1978})
\begin{align}
\dot{P_1} &= (r_1-E_2 P_2) u_1 P_1 \\

If we set $E=E_1=E_2$, $r=r_1=r_2$, and $P_0=P_{1,0}=P_{2,0}$ and then renormalize $P_1\rightarrow EP_1$ and $P_2\rightarrow EP_2$, then the equations simplify to (\citep[Eq.\ 4--4 -- 4--8]{mirmirani_competition_1978})

\subsection{Environmental Effects}

\citet{mironchenko_optimal_2014} present a flexible growth model coupled with more realistic depictions of seasonality and time-varying effects. This flexibility gives them the ability to determine under what conditions a variety of life histories are optimal. The model is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\dot x_1 &= v_1(t)g(x_3) - \mu(t) x_1                  \\
\dot x_2 &= \left(v(t)-v_1(t)\right)g(x_3)             \\
\dot x_3 &= \zeta(t)f(x_1) - v(t)g(x_3) -\omega(t)x_3
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $x_1$ is vegetative tissue, $x_2$ is reproductive tissue, $x_3$ is storage tissue, $v\in[0,1]$ and $v_1\in[0,v]$ are control variables allocating storage tissue at a maximal rate of $g(x_3)$, $f(x_1)$ is the rate of photosynthesis in optimal environment conditions, $\zeta(t)$ models the dependence of the photosynthetic rate on the environment ($\zeta(t)=0$ implies no photosynthesis is possible), $\mu(t)$ is the loss rate of vegetative tissues, and $\omega(t)$ is the loss rate of storage tissues.

The optimal rate of photosynthesis, $f(x)$, always has the form
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \frac{ax}{bx+k}
\end{equation}
while the achievable fraction of photosynthesis, $\zeta(t)$, remains the same throughout the systems \citeauthor{mironchenko_optimal_2014} test:
\begin{equation}
\zeta(t) = 0.2 + 0.8 \left\lvert \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{12}t\right)\right\rvert
\end{equation}
its periodic form might represent, e.g., seasonal temperature variation. $\mu$ and $\omega$ often have periodic forms as well.

To convert this model to our form, we note that the control variables $v$ and $v_1$ apportion up to $g(x_3)$ energy between $x_1$ and $x_2$. Therefore, we can replace them with two control variables $u_1,u_2\ge 0$ constrained such that $u_1+u_2\le g(x_3)$. Doing this and discretizing per usual gives us the system:
\begin{maxi}|s|
  {u(t)}{x_{2,T}}
  {}{}
  \addConstraint{x_{1,t+1}}{= x_{1,t} + \Delta t \cdot \left(u_{1,t} - \mu(t) x_1 \right)}
  \addConstraint{x_{2,t+1}}{= x_{2,t} + \Delta t \cdot u_{2,t}}
  \addConstraint{x_{3,t+1}}{= x_{3,t} + \Delta t \cdot \left(\zeta(t) f(x_{1,t}) - u_{1,t} - u_{2,t} - \omega(t) x_{3,t}\right)}
  \addConstraint{x_{1,0}}{= 0.05 m}
  \addConstraint{x_{2,0}}{= 0     }
  \addConstraint{x_{3,0}}{= 0.95 m}
  \addConstraint{u_{1,t}+u_{2,t}}{\le g(x_3)}
\end{maxi}
where $m$ is the initial seed mass. The introduction of the time-varying functions $\zeta,\omega,\mu$ don't make our modeling job more difficult. Since we've discretized over time, we can just evaluate these functions at each time point and insert the result as a constant into our model.

\subsubsection{Inducing Multiple Reproduction Periods}
\label{sec:annual-multi}
What is the effect of periodic vegetative tissue loss on an annual, as might be caused by herbivores grazing repeatedly over the same area as it regrows? To answer this, \citeauthor{mironchenko_optimal_2014} instantiate the above model for two environments

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\textbf{Variable} & \textbf{Stable Environment}                 & \textbf{Unstable Environment}     \\
$\omega(t)=$      & $0.05$                                      & $t / (1 + 0.5 t)$                 \\
$\mu(t)=$         & $0.8 \lvert \cos(\frac{\pi}{12}t) \rvert$   & $1.8 \lvert \cos(\pi t) \rvert$   \\
$g(x_3)=$         & $5x_3$                                      & $16x_3$                           \\
$f(x_1)=$         & $1.5/(1+0.03x_1)$                           & $4/(1+0.03x_1)$                   \\
Outcome           & Single reproductive period                  & Multiple reproductive periods
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note that while the stable environment has a $\mu(t)$ that's periodic over the course of a year, as would be the case for seasonal vegetative loses, the unstable environment has a $\mu(t)$ that varies monthly, perhaps as levels of herbivory fluctuate. To survive this stability the plant in the unstable environment needs a higher maximum storage conversion rate $g(x_3)$ and greater optimal photosynthetic efficiency $f(x_1)$. The unstable plant's $\omega(t)$ was chosen by \citeauthor{mironchenko_optimal_2014} as a saturating function to help emphasize the control variables and costates.

In this paper's modeling language the above becomes:

\inputminted[firstline=5,frame=single,linenos]{python}{src/Mironchenko2014_figure2.py}

Running the above program gives us the result shown in \autoref{fig:mironchenko-fig2}. Note that the low levels of vegetative tissue lost in the stable environment result in continuous reproductive output, even though the loss levels are fluctuating. Even though the unstable environment is more favourable for the plant, having greater photosynthesis and faster storage conversion, strong fluctuations in vegetative tissue loss result in pulsed reproductive output.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
We can instantiate these environments in this paper's modeling language through minor modifications to the program shown in \autoref{sec:annual-multi}.

As shown in \autoref{fig:mironchenko-fig5ae}, the ``Constantly Harsh" environment causes the plant to lose significant vegetative tissue over winters. It makes up for this by moving energy into storage. The ``Constant Mortality" produces a similar result via a different means. For this, we set $\omega(t)=0$, but model the plant has having a 3\% chance of dying at any given moment. This implies that the probability $L(t)$ of surviving to an age $t$ is given by $L(t)=e^{-0.03t}$. The plant's goal is then to maximize its expected lifetime fitness, which is given by
\begin{equation}
\int_0^T L(t) \dot x_2(t) dt
\end{equation}
incorporating this into our modeling language is straight-forward
\inputminted[firstline=37,lastline=38,frame=single]{python}{src/Mironchenko2014_figure5e.py}

Contrast this with the the ``Pleasant'' and ``Very Pleasant'' environments, as shown in \autoref{fig:mironchenko-fig4and5c}. The decreased over-winter tissue loss ($\mu$) in the pleasant environment means that even though storage losses ($\omega$) are smaller, the plant's best strategy is to accept some tissue losses rather than waste energy on using storage. In the ``Very Pleasant" environment, the plant is again subject to higher over-winter tissue loss ($\mu$), but storage costs are very low. The biggest difference, though is that the plant has minimal self-shading. This is modeled by choosing a maximum photosynthetic rate ($f$) with a denominator ($1+0.01x_1$) that is small for most values of $x_1$ the plant will encounter.

\subsection{The Forward-Euler Method}
\label{sec:euler}

TODO


\subsection{Hyperbolic constraints}

\subsubsection{As SOCPs}

For a vector $\vec{w}$ a constraint of the form
\begin{equation}
\vec{w}^T\vec{w}=\lVert\vec{w}\rVert^2_2\le xy,~~~x\ge0,~~~y\ge0
\end{equation}
can be transformed into the SOCP constraint
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:hyperbolic-to-socp}
\left\lVert \begin{bmatrix} 2\vec{w} \\ x - y \end{bmatrix} \right\rVert_2 \le x+y
\end{equation}
Note that the optimal value of a scalar $w$ produced this way is the squart root of $xy$.

% \subsection{Converting square roots to SOCPs}

% A constraint of the form
% \begin{equation}
% \sqrt{x}\ge t
% \end{equation}
% can be transformed into the SOCP constraints
% \begin{equation}
% \left\lVert \begin{bmatrix} 1-x \\ 2t \end{bmatrix} \right\rVert_2 \le 1+x
% \end{equation}



\subsection{Michaelis--Menten Kinetics}
\label{sec:mmkinetics}

The Michaelis--Menten relates the rate $y$ of an enzymatic reaction to the concentration $x$ of a substrate, as follows
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:mm}
Y = \frac{\beta_1 X}{\beta_2 + X}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are positive parameters.

\autoref{equ:mm} most often appears in our context as a saturating limit to growth, e.g., $\textrm{growth}\le\frac{\beta_1 X}{\beta_2 + X}$. Since optimizing reproductive fitness often means maximizing growth, we anticipate that the inequality will be binding. \autoref{equ:mm} is therefore equivalent to the hyperbolic constraint
\begin{align}
\label{equ:mm-hyper}
\hat{X}^2+\hat{Y}^2 &\le (\hat{X}-\hat{Y})(2\beta_1\beta_2+\hat{X}-\hat{Y}) \\
   0    &\le \hat{X}-\hat{Y}
\end{align}
were $\hat{X}=\beta_1 X$ and $\hat{Y}=\beta_2Y$; this can be proven by simplifying \autoref{equ:mm-hyper}. Converting this to the standard SOC form using \autoref{equ:hyperbolic-to-socp} gives
\begin{equation}
\left\lVert \begin{bmatrix} \hat{X} \\ \hat{Y} \\ \beta_1\beta_2 \end{bmatrix} \right\rVert_2 \le \beta_1\beta_2 + \hat{X} - \hat{Y}
\end{equation}
and substituting in $\hat{X}$ and $\hat{Y}$ gives
\begin{equation}
\left\lVert \begin{bmatrix} \beta_1 X \\ \beta_2 Y \\ \beta_1\beta_2 \end{bmatrix} \right\rVert_2 \le \beta_1\beta_2 + \beta_1 X - \beta_2 Y
\end{equation}

Note that if our M-M kinetics equation is instead
\begin{equation}
  Y = \frac{\beta_1 X}{\beta_2 + \beta_3 X}
\end{equation}
we can convert to the canonical form by taking
\begin{equation}
  Y = \frac{(\beta_1/\beta_3) X}{(\beta_2/\beta_3) + X}
\end{equation}

An application of this technique to gradostat design is discussed in~\citep{Taylor2021}.



\subsection{SOS2 Constraints}
\label{sec:sos2}

An SOS2 constraint is defined by specifying a set of variables $\{t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n\}$ and is equivalent to the following three constraints:
\begin{itemize}
\item $t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n\ge0$
\item $t_1+t_2+\ldots+t_n=1$
\item At most two adjacent variables, $t_i$ and potentially $t_{i+1}$ can be non-zero
\end{itemize}
SOS2 constraints are useful for modeling piecewise-linear functions, as described in \autoref{sec:linearlambda}. If a solver doesn't have SOS2 constraints but has binary variables, these can be used to construct an equivalent, though less efficient, formulation.



\subsection{Linearizing Functions}
\label{sec:linearlambda}

%TODO: The importance of separable functions in a mathematical programming model lies in the fact that they can be approximated to by piecewise linear functions. It is then possible to use separable programming to obtain a global optimum to a convex problem or possibly only a local optimum for a non-convex problem.

One way to handle a non-linear function $f(x)$ is to approximate it as a piecewise-linear function of $n$ line segments using a standard $\lambda$-form transformation~\citep{Williams2013}. For $f(x)$ in the range $[a,b]$ and a step size $s=(b-a)/n$, we add the following constraints to the model: %TODO: See Williams, p. 149
\begin{align}
x &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  (a+is) \lambda_{i} \\
y &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(a+is) \lambda_{i} \\
1 &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}         \lambda_{i} \\
&\textrm{at most two adjacent $\lambda_{i}$ can be nonzero} \label{equ:adjlambda}
\end{align}
now, $y$ is a linear approximation of $f(x)$ and can be used in its place anywhere in the model. The constraint given by \autoref{equ:adjlambda} is nonlinear. However, if $f(x)$ has diminishing returns and we are maximizing our objective then this constraint is guaranteed to be true and need not be explicitly included in the model~\citep{Williams2013}. (Once the model has been solved, the values of $\lambda$ can be checked as a verification measure.) For cases where the above doesn't hold, most solvers include \textit{SOS2} constraints as a way to enforce \autoref{equ:adjlambda} (see \autoref{sec:sos2}).

and (3)~that the timing and quantity of allocations evolve to maximize an individual's lifetime reproductive output weighted by a yearly survival probability. %Find a more generalized phrase than "risk discounting". Think about "individual plant's"
